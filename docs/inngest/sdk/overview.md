# Installing the SDK

The Inngest SDK allows you to write reliable, durable functions in your existing projects incrementally. Functions can be automatically triggered by events or run on a schedule without infrastructure, and can be fully serverless or added to your existing HTTP server.

- It works with any framework and platform by using HTTP to call your functions
- It supports serverless providers, without any additional infrastructure
- It fully supports TypeScript out of the box
- You can locally test your code without any extra setup

## Getting started

### Installation

To get started, install the SDK via your favorite package manager:

```shell {{ title: "npm" }}
npm install inngest
```

```shell {{ title: "yarn" }}
yarn add inngest
```

```shell {{ title: "pnpm" }}
pnpm add inngest
```

```shell {{ title: "bun" }}
bun add inngest
```

### Setup

Once Inngest is installed, create an Inngest client, later used to define your functions and trigger events:

```typescript
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

export const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "my-app",
});
```

To get started, install the SDK via `go get`:

```shell
go get github.com/inngest/inngestgo
```

### Installation

To get started, install the SDK via `pip`:

```shell
pip install inngest
```

### Setup

Once Inngest is installed, create an Inngest client, later used to define your functions and trigger events:

```python
import inngest
import logging

# Create an Inngest client
inngest_client = inngest.Inngest(
    app_id="app_example",
    logger=logging.getLogger("uvicorn"),
)
```

Your project is now ready to start writing Inngest functions:

2. [Trigger functions with events](/docs-markdown/events)
3. [Set up and serve the Inngest API for your framework](/docs-markdown/learn/serving-inngest-functions)
