# Workflow Kit

Workflow Kit enables you to build [user-defined workflows](/docs-markdown/guides/user-defined-workflows) with Inngest by providing a set of workflow actions to the **[Workflow Engine](/docs-markdown/reference/workflow-kit/engine)** while using the **[pre-built React components](/docs-markdown/reference/workflow-kit/components-api)** to build your Workflow Editor UI.

## Installing
