# Agent Skills

Inngest Skills provides pre-built [agent skills](https://agentskills.io) for AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf. They give your coding agent comprehensive, up-to-date guidance on building reliable applications with Inngest — from initial setup to advanced flow control.

> **Callout:** Inngest Skills is open source at github.com/inngest/inngest-skills.

## Why use agent skills?

Instead of relying on an AI model's training data (which may be outdated or incomplete), agent skills provide:

- **Current API knowledge** — Accurate function signatures, configuration options, and best practices
- **Step-by-step guidance** — Structured instructions for common Inngest patterns
- **Workflow templates** — Proven patterns for background jobs, scheduled tasks, and event-driven workflows

## Installation

```bash {{ title: "Claude Code" }}
/plugin marketplace add inngest-skills
```

```bash {{ title: "Skills.sh" }}
npx skills add inngest/inngest-skills
```

```text {{ title: "Cursor" }}
# Add to your .cursorrules file:
Load the Inngest skills from https://github.com/inngest/inngest-skills for building with Inngest's durable execution platform.
```

For other agents, reference the [repository](https://github.com/inngest/inngest-skills) directly or clone it to your agent's skills directory. Each skill is self-contained with full documentation in its `SKILL.md` file.

## Available skills

| Skill                         | Description                                  | What it covers                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **inngest-setup**             | Set up Inngest in a TypeScript project       | SDK installation, client config, environment variables, dev server             |
| **inngest-events**            | Design and send Inngest events               | Event schema, naming conventions, idempotency, fan-out patterns, system events |
| **inngest-durable-functions** | Create and configure durable functions       | Triggers, step execution, memoization, cancellation, error handling, retries   |
| **inngest-steps**             | Use step methods to build durable workflows  | `step.run`, `step.sleep`, `step.waitForEvent`, loops, parallel execution       |
| **inngest-flow-control**      | Configure flow control for functions         | Concurrency limits, throttling, rate limiting, debounce, priority, batching    |
| **inngest-middleware**        | Create middleware for cross-cutting concerns | Middleware lifecycle, dependency injection, built-in middleware                |

## Language support

These skills are currently focused on **TypeScript**. Core concepts like events, steps, and flow control apply across all Inngest SDKs, but code examples and setup instructions are TypeScript-specific.

For Python or Go, refer to the [Inngest documentation](/docs) and [llms.txt](https://www.inngest.com/llms.txt) for language-specific guidance.

## Combine with Dev Server MCP

For the best AI development experience, use agent skills alongside the [Inngest Dev Server MCP integration](/docs-markdown/ai-dev-tools/mcp). Together they provide:

- **Skills** give your agent knowledge of *how* to write correct Inngest code
- **MCP** gives your agent the ability to *interact* with your running dev server — list functions, send events, and monitor runs

This enables a complete write, test, and debug loop powered by your coding agent.
