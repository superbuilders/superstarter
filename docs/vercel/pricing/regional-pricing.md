# Regional pricing

When using Managed Infrastructure resources on Vercel, some, but not all, are priced based on region. The following table shows the price range for resources priced by region. Your team will be charged based on the usage of your projects for each resource per region.

The **Included** column shows the amount of usage covered in your [billing cycle](/docs/pricing/understanding-my-invoice#understanding-your-invoice). If you use more than this amount, the **Additional** column lists the rates for any extra usage as a range.

> **💡 Note:** Active CPU and Provisioned Memory are billed at different rates depending on
> the region your [fluid compute](/docs/fluid-compute) is deployed. The rates
> for each region can be found in the [fluid
> pricing](/docs/functions/usage-and-pricing) documentation.

## Specific region pricing
