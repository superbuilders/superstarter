# Taxes

### Do you charge sales tax, value-added tax (VAT) or equivalent on your services?

Yes. We are rolling out collection of VAT, GST, or equivalent for international customers starting on April 1, 2026 for all Vercel products and services where required by law. We already collect sales tax for US-based customers. The exact amount depends on your billing address and applicable tax regulations.

### Why are you starting to collect sales tax and VAT now?

Regulations require cloud service providers to collect sales tax and VAT in many jurisdictions. We're updating our billing practices to ensure full compliance.

### Will all customers be charged sales tax and VAT?

Not necessarily. Sales tax and VAT are only charged in jurisdictions where Vercel is registered to collect tax. If your billing address is in one of those jurisdictions, you will see sales tax or VAT added to your invoices. If not, you will not be charged tax.

### How will sales tax and VAT appear on my invoice?

Invoices will now show a separate line item for sales tax or VAT, clearly indicating the amount charged in addition to the products and services purchased.

### Do I need to take any action regarding sales tax and VAT?

For most customers, no action is required. Vercel automatically calculates and adds sales tax or VAT to your invoice based on your billing information.

However, if your US-based organization is tax-exempt, please send your exemption certificate to <tax@vercel.com>. If your international organization is VAT-registered, you'll need to provide us with a valid VAT ID number in your billing settings.

### What if my organization is tax-exempt?

If you qualify for tax exemption in the US, please send your exemption certificate to <tax@vercel.com>. Once our team verifies your certificate, we'll mark your account as tax-exempt, and sales tax won't be applied to your invoices.

If your organization is VAT-registered, our system will automatically handle this if you've provided a valid VAT ID number. You may have an obligation to self-report the VAT under the reverse charge mechanism.

### When will international customers start being charged VAT?

We will start collecting VAT for invoices issued on and after April 1, 2026.

### Where can I find more information about Vercel's terms of service about tax?

You can refer to our [terms of service](/legal/terms#payments) on collecting sales tax and VAT.

### Who can I contact with tax-related questions?

If you have specific questions about tax collection or exemptions, please contact our team at <tax@vercel.com>.
