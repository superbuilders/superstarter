# Pricing for Flags Explorer

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Flags Explorer

## Pricing

The following table outlines the price for each resource according to the plan you are on:

| Resource            | Hobby | Pro               | Enterprise        |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Unlimited Overrides | N/A   | $250.00 per month | $250.00 per month |

Unlimited overrides can be managed in your [team's billing settings](/d?to=%2Fteams%2F%5Bteam%5D%2Fsettings%2Fbilling\&title=Go+to+Billing+Settings). Alternatively, if you have the necessary permissions, you can enable this feature directly in the Flags Explorer once you reach the limit.

### Limits per plan

When not subscribed to the unlimited option, Hobby, Pro and Enterprise have a limited amount of monthly overrides:

|           | Hobby         | Pro           | Enterprise    |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Overrides | 150 per month | 150 per month | 150 per month |

*One override directly translates to one click on the apply button of the Flags
Explorer, which means that multiple flags can be overriden in one go.*
