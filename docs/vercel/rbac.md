# Role-based access control (RBAC)

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Team roles

Teams consist of members, and each member of a team can get assigned a role. These roles define what you can and cannot do within a team on Vercel.

As your project scales and you add more team members, you can assign them roles to ensure that they have the right permissions to work on your projects.

Vercel offers a range of roles for your team members. When deciding what role a member should have on your team, consider the following:

- What projects does this team member need to access?
- What actions does this team member need to perform on these projects?
- What actions does this team member need to perform on the team itself?

See the [Managing team members](/docs/rbac/managing-team-members) section for information on setting up and managing team members.

For specific information on the different access roles available on each plan, see the [Access Roles](/docs/rbac/access-roles) section.
