# Using the Activity Log

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Activity Log

The [Activity Log](/dashboard/activity) provides a list of all events on a [team](/docs/accounts#teams), chronologically organized since its creation. These events include:

- User(s) involved with the event
- Type of event performed
- Type of account
- Time of the event (hover over the time to reveal the exact timestamp)

> **💡 Note:** Vercel does not emit any logs to third-party services. The Activity Log is
> only available to the account owner and team members.

## When to use the Activity log

Common use cases for viewing the Activity log include:

- If a user was removed or deleted by mistake, use the list to find when the event happened and who requested it
- A domain can be disconnected from your deployment. Use the list to see if a domain related event was recently triggered
- Check if a specific user was removed from a team

## Events logged
