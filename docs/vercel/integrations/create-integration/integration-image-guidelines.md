# Integration Image Guidelines

These guidelines help ensure consistent, high-quality previews for integrations across the Vercel platform.

See [Clerk's Integration](https://vercel.com/marketplace/clerk) for a strong example.

## 1. Rules on image layout

a. Images must use a 16:9 layout (1920 × 1080 minimum).

b. Layouts must have symmetrical margins and a reasonable safe area.

c. All images must have both a central visual asset and a description.

## 2. Rules on central visual assets

a. Central visual assets must offer a real glimpse into the product.

b. Central visual assets shouldn't be full window screenshots. Instead, you should showcase product components.

c. Products with GUIs must have at least one central visual asset displaying a component of the GUI.

d. You can include additional decor as long as it does not overpower the central visual asset.

## 3. Rules on descriptions

a. Descriptions must explain the paired visual asset.

b. Descriptions must be clear and concise.

c. Descriptions must follow proper grammar.

## 4. Rules on image design

a. Images must meet a baseline design standard and maintain a consistent visual style across all assets.

b. Images must be accessible and legible. You should ensure good contrast and type size.

c. Avoid unnecessary clutter on images and focus on clarity.

d. All images must be high-resolution to prevent any pixelation.

e. Images should clearly highlight the most compelling parts of the UI and showcase features that are valuable to customers.
