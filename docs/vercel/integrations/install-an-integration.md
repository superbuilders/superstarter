# Extend your Vercel Workflow

## Installing an integration

Using Vercel doesn't stop at the products and features that we provide. Through integrations, you can use third-party platforms or services to extend the capabilities of Vercel by:

- Connecting your Vercel account and project with a third-party service. See [Add a connectable account](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/add-a-connectable-account) to learn more.
- Buying or subscribing to a product with a third-party service that you will use with your Vercel project. see [Add a Native Integration](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/product-integration) to learn more.
- Interacting with your installed integrations through a chat interface. See [Agent Tools](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/agent-tools) to learn more.

## Find integrations

You can extend the Vercel platform through the [Marketplace](#marketplace), [templates](#templates), or [third-party site](#third-party-site).

### Marketplace

The [Integrations Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations) is the best way to find suitable integrations that fit into a variety of workflows including [monitoring](/integrations#monitoring), [databases](https://vercel.com/integrations#databases), [CMS](https://vercel.com/integrations#cms), [DevTools](https://vercel.com/integrations#dev-tools), [Testing with the checks API](/marketplace/category/testing), and more.

You have access to two types of integrations:

- **Native integrations** that include  that you can buy and use in your Vercel project after you installed the integration
- **Connectable accounts** that allow you to connect third-party services to your Vercel project

Once installed, you can interact with native integrations through [Agent Tools](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/agent-tools).

- [Permissions and Access](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/manage-integrations-reference)
- [Add a Native Integration](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/product-integration)
- [Billing](/docs/integrations/create-integration/billing)
- [Agent Tools](/docs/integrations/install-an-integration/agent-tools)

### Templates

You can use one of our verified and pre-built [templates](/templates) to learn more about integrating your favorite tools and get a quickstart on development. When you deploy a template using the [Deploy Button](/docs/deploy-button), the deployment may prompt you to install related integrations to connect with a third-party service.

### Third-party site

Integration creators can prompt you to install their Vercel Integration through their app or website.

When installing or using an integration, your data may be collected or
disclosed to Vercel. Your information may also be sent to the integration
creator per our [Privacy Notice](/legal/privacy-policy). Third party
integrations are available "as is" and not operated or controlled by Vercel.
We suggest reviewing the terms and policies for the integration and/or
contacting the integration creator directly for further information on their
privacy practices.
