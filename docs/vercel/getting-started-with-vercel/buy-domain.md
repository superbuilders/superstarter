# Buy a domain

Use Vercel to find and buy a domain that resonates with your brand, establishes credibility, and captures your visitors' attention.

> **💡 Note:** All domains purchased on Vercel have WHOIS privacy enabled by default.

- ### Find a domain
  Go to [https://vercel.com/domains](/domains) and search for a domain that matches you or your brand. You could try "SuperDev"!

  Depending on the TLD (top-level domain), you’ll see the purchase price. Domains with **Premium** badges are more expensive. You can sort the results by relevance (default), length, price, or alphabetical order.

- ### Select your domain(s)
  - Select an address by clicking the  button next to the available domain, or continue searching until you find the perfect one.
  - When you click the  button, Vercel adds the domain to your domains cart. You can continue to add more domains from the same results or search for new ones.

- ### Purchase your domain(s)
  - Click on the **Cart**  button on the top right and review the list of domains and prices that you added.
  - Then, click **Proceed to Checkout**. You can also change the team under which you are making this purchase at this stage.

- ### Enter payment details and registrant information
  - You'll need to enter your billing and credit card details to purchase the domain on the checkout page. These details are saved for [auto renewal](/docs/domains/renew-a-domain).
  - You'll also need to enter your registrant information and confirm it for [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/) purposes.
  - Click **Buy** to complete the purchase.
  > **💡 Note:** For the ICANN registrant information:

- ### Configure your domain
  - Once the purchase is complete, you can click **Configure** next to each purchased domain on the checkout page.
  - You'll have the following options:
    - Connect the domain to an existing project
    - Create a new project to connect the domain to
    - Manage the domain's DNS records
  You can also configure your domain from the [project's domains dashboard page](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fsettings%2Fdomains\&title=Go+to+your+project%27s+domain) by following the [Add and configure domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains/add-a-domain) instructions.
