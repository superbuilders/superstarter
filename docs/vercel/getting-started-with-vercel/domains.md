# Add a domain

Assigning a custom domain to your project guarantees that visitors to your application will have a tailored experience that aligns with your brand.

On Vercel, this domain can have any format of your choosing:

- `acme.com` ([apex domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains#apex-domain))
- `blog.acme.com` ([subdomain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains#subdomain))
- `*.acme.com` ([wildcard domain](/docs/domains/working-with-domains#wildcard-domain))

If you already own a domain, you can point it to Vercel, or transfer it over. If you don't own one yet, you can purchase a new one. For this tutorial, feel free to use that one domain you bought 11 months ago and haven’t got around to using yet!

For more information on domains at Vercel, see [Domains overview](/docs/domains).

### Next steps

Now that your site is deployed, you can to personalize it by setting up a custom domain. With Vercel you can either **buy a new domain** or **use an existing domain**.
