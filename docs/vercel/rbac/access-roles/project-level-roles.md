# Project Level Roles

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Project level roles

Project level roles are assigned to a team member on a project level. This means that the role is only valid for the project it is assigned to. The role is not valid for other projects in the team.

## Equivalency roles

In the table below, the relationship between team and project roles is indicated by the column headers. For example, the team role "Developer" is equivalent to the "Project Developer" role.

- The [**Developer**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#developer-role) team role is equivalent to the [**Project Developer**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#project-developer) role
- The [**Viewer Pro**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#viewer-pro-role), [**Viewer Enterprise**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#viewer-enterprise-role), and [**Billing**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#billing-role) team roles are equivalent to the [**Project Viewer**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#project-viewer) role
- The [**Owner**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) and [**Member**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#member-role) team roles are equivalent to the [**Project Admin**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#project-administrators) role

All project level roles can be assigned to those with the [**Contributor**](/docs/rbac/access-roles#team-level-roles) team role.

See our [Access roles docs](/docs/rbac/access-roles) for a more comprehensive breakdown of the different roles.
