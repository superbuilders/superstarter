# Team Level Roles

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: Team level roles

Team level roles are designed to provide a comprehensive level of control and access to the team as a whole. These roles are assigned to individuals and are applicable to all projects within the team. This allows for a centralized level of control and access, while still maintaining the security and integrity of the team as a whole.

> **💡 Note:** While the [Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise) plan supports all the below
> roles, the [Pro](/docs/plans/pro-plan) plan only supports
> [Owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role),
> [Member](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role), and
> [Billing](/docs/rbac/access-roles#billing-role).
