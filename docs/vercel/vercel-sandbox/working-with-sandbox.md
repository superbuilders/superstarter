# Working with Sandbox

This page covers common tasks when working with Vercel Sandbox.

## Execute long-running tasks

By default, sandboxes timeout after 5 minutes. For longer tasks, set a custom timeout when creating the sandbox:

To extend a running sandbox, call `extendTimeout`:

See [Pricing and Limits](/docs/vercel-sandbox/pricing#runtime-limits) for maximum durations by plan.

## Debug with an interactive shell

Connect to a running sandbox for interactive debugging with an SSH-like experience:

```bash
sandbox connect <sandbox-id>
```

Once connected, you have full shell access to inspect logs, check processes, and explore the filesystem.

See [CLI Reference](/docs/vercel-sandbox/cli-reference#sandbox-connect) for all options.

## Monitor your sandbox

View your sandboxes in the [Sandboxes dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fobservability%2Fsandboxes\&title=Show+Sandbox+Page). For each project, you can see:

- Total sandboxes created
- Currently running sandboxes
- Stopped sandboxes
- Command history and sandbox URLs

Track compute usage across projects in the [Usage dashboard](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2Fdashboard%2F%5Bteam%5D%2Fusage\&title=Show+Usage+Page), which measures:

- **Sandbox Provisioned Memory**: Memory allocated to your sandboxes
- **Sandbox Data Transfer**: Data transferred in and out
- **Sandbox Active CPU**: CPU time consumed
- **Sandbox Creations**: Number of sandboxes created
- **Snapshot Storage**: Sandbox snapshot storage

## Stop a sandbox

There are three ways to stop a sandbox:

### Through the dashboard

1. Go to [Sandboxes](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fobservability%2Fsandboxes\&title=Show+Sandbox+Page) in **Observability**.
2. Select your sandbox.
3. Click **Stop Sandbox**.

### Programmatically

### Automatic timeout

Sandboxes stop automatically when their timeout expires. The default is 5 minutes.
