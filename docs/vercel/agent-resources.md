# Agent Resources

Vercel provides resources to help you build AI-powered applications and work more effectively with AI coding assistants. Access documentation in machine-readable formats, connect AI tools directly to Vercel, and install agent skills for specialized capabilities.

## llms-full.txt

The `llms-full.txt` file provides a comprehensive, machine-readable version of Vercel's documentation optimized for large language models.

**URL:** [`https://vercel.com/docs/llms-full.txt`](https://vercel.com/docs/llms-full.txt)

Use this file to give AI assistants full context about Vercel's platform, features, and best practices. This is helpful when you want an AI to understand Vercel comprehensively before answering questions or generating code.

### Using llms-full.txt with AI tools

You can reference the llms-full.txt file in various AI tools:

- **Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini**: Paste the URL or content into your conversation
- **Cursor, Windsurf**: Add the URL to your project's context or rules
- **Claude Code**: Use the `WebFetch` tool to fetch the content

## Markdown access

Every documentation page is available as markdown. This makes it simple to feed specific documentation into AI tools.

See [Markdown access](/docs/agent-resources/markdown-access) for details on:

- Accessing any page with the `.md` extension
- Using the "Copy as Markdown" button
- Feeding documentation to AI assistants

## Vercel MCP server

The [Vercel MCP server](/docs/agent-resources/vercel-mcp) connects AI assistants directly to your Vercel account using the Model Context Protocol. This lets AI tools:

- Search Vercel documentation
- List and manage your projects
- View deployment details and logs
- Check domain availability

## Skills.sh

[Skills.sh](https://skills.sh) is the open ecosystem for reusable AI agent capabilities. Skills are procedural knowledge packages that enhance AI coding assistants with specialized expertise.

Install skills with a single command:

```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo>
```

Skills.sh supports 18+ AI agents including Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, and many others. The directory contains skills covering:

- Framework-specific guidance (React, Vue, Next.js, and more)
- Development tools (testing, deployment, documentation)
- Specialized domains (security, infrastructure, marketing)

See [Agent Skills](/docs/agent-resources/skills) for the complete list of Vercel-provided skills, or browse the [Skills.sh directory](https://skills.sh) to find skills from the community.

## CLI workflows

End-to-end workflows that show AI agents how to compose Vercel CLI commands into complete work sessions. Each workflow covers a full task from start to finish, including the reasoning between steps.

See [CLI Workflows](/docs/agent-resources/workflows) for the full list, including:

- [Debugging production 500 errors](/docs/observability/debug-production-errors)
- [Rolling back a production deployment](/docs/deployments/rollback-production-deployment)
- [Debugging slow Vercel Functions](/docs/functions/debug-slow-functions)
- [Deploying a project from the CLI](/docs/projects/deploy-from-cli)
