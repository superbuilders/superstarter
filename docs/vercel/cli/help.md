# vercel help

The `vercel help` command generates a list of all available Vercel CLI commands and [options](/docs/cli/global-options) in the terminal. When combined with a second argument - a valid Vercel CLI command - it outputs more detailed information about that command.

Alternatively, the [`--help` global option](/docs/cli/global-options#help) can be added to commands to get help information about that command.
