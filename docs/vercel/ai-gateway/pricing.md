# Pricing

AI Gateway uses a pay-as-you-go model with no markups. Purchase [AI Gateway Credits](#top-up-your-ai-gateway-credits) and Vercel automatically deducts charges from your balance.

## Free and paid tiers

Every Vercel team account gets access to both a free tier and a paid tier for AI Gateway Credits. **For the paid tier, AI Gateway provides tokens with zero markup, including when you bring your own key.**

Your free credits start when you make your first AI Gateway request. To run larger workloads, you can purchase AI Gateway Credits at any time with no obligation to renew. Once you purchase credits, your account transitions to the paid tier and the monthly free credit no longer applies.

## AI Gateway Rates

Whether you use a free or paid account, you'll pay the AI Gateway rates listed in the Models section of the [**AI Gateway**](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fai-gateway\&title=Go+to+AI+Gateway) tab for each request. AI Gateway bases its rates on the provider's list price.

The charge for each request depends on the AI provider and model you select, and the number of input and output tokens processed. **You're responsible for any payment processing fees that may apply.**

### Finding model pricing

You can find the most up-to-date pricing for all models in two places:

- [**AI Gateway Model List**](/ai-gateway/models): Browse all available models with pricing information
