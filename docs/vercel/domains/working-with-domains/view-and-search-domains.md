# Viewing & Searching Domains

## Viewing domains

To view all your registered domains, go to the **Domains** tab in your Vercel dashboard.

The domains list will show you all domains that are currently active on your account, and display the following information:

- **Domain** - The domain name
- **Registrar and status** - The domain registrar (Vercel or Third Party). If the registrar is Vercel, you will see the renewal or expiry status of the domain
- **Creator** - The person who created the domain, indicated by their avatar and username and include the creation date

## Searching domains

You can search for a specific domain by using the search bar above the domains list.

It is not possible to search a multi-level wildcard subdomain. It is only possible to search a subdomain at one level down.
