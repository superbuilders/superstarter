# Toolbar Browser Extensions

> **🔒 Permissions Required**: The browser extensions

The browser extension is supported in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge, in addition to other Chromium-based browsers that support extensions and enhances the toolbar in the following ways:

- Enables the toolbar to detect when you are logged in to Vercel.
- Operates faster and with fewer network requests.
- Remembers your [personal preferences](#setting-user-preferences) for when the toolbar hides and activates.
- Allows you to [take screenshots](#taking-screenshots-with-the-extension) and attach them to comments.
- Click the extension to hide and show the toolbar, and pin it to your browser bar for quick access.

## Installing the browser extension

Install the browser extension from your browser's extension page:

- [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vercel/lahhiofdgnbcgmemekkmjnpifojdaelb)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vercel)

You can also install the Chrome extension using the link above in Opera and Microsoft Edge.

## Setting user preferences

With the browser extension you are able to toggle on the following preferences that affect how the toolbar behaves for you without altering its behavior for your team members:

| Setting         | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Always Activate | Sets the toolbar to activate anytime you are authenticated as your Vercel user instead of waiting to be clicked.                                       |
| Start Hidden    | Sets the toolbar to start hidden. Read more about [hiding and showing the toolbar](/docs/vercel-toolbar/managing-toolbar#disable-toolbar-for-session). |

## Taking screenshots with the extension

The extension enables you to leave comments with screenshots attached by clicking, dragging, and releasing to select the area of the page you'd like to screenshot and comment on. To do this:

1. Select **Comment** in the toolbar menu.
2. Click, drag, and release to select the area of the page you'd like to screenshot.
