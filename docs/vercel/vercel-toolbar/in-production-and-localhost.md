# Add the Vercel Toolbar to local and production environments

The Vercel Toolbar is available by default on all [preview environments](/docs/deployments/environments#preview-environment-pre-production). In production environments the toolbar supports ongoing team collaboration and project iteration. When used in development environments, you can see and resolve preview comments during development, streamlining the process of iterating on your project.

All toolbar features such as [Comments](/docs/comments/using-comments), [Feature Flags](/docs/feature-flags), [Draft Mode](/docs/draft-mode), and [Edit Mode](/docs/edit-mode), are available in both production and development environments.
