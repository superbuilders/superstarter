# Build with AI on Vercel

AI services and models help enhance and automate the building and deployment of applications for various use cases:

- Chatbots and virtual assistants improve customer interactions.
- AI-powered content generation automates and optimizes digital content.
- Recommendation systems deliver personalized experiences.
- Natural language processing (NLP) enables advanced text analysis and translation.
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances documentation with context-aware responses.
- AI-driven image and media services optimize visual content.

## Integrating with AI providers

With Vercel AI integrations, you can build and deploy these AI-powered applications efficiently. Through the Vercel Marketplace, you can research which AI service fits your needs with example use cases. Then, you can install and manage two types of AI integrations:

- **Native integrations**: Built-in solutions that work seamlessly with Vercel and include resources with built-in billing and account provisioning.
- **Connectable accounts**: Third-party services you can link to your projects.

## Using AI integrations

You can view your installed AI integrations by navigating to the **AI** tab of your Vercel [dashboard](/dashboard). If you don't have installed integrations, you can browse and connect to the AI models and services that best fit your project's needs. Otherwise, you will see a list of your installed native and connectable account integrations, with an indication of which project(s) they are connected to. You will be able to browse available services, models and templates below the list of installed integrations.

See the [adding a provider](/docs/agent-resources/integrations-for-models/adding-a-provider) guide to learn how to add a provider to your Vercel project, or the [adding a model](/docs/agent-resources/integrations-for-models/adding-a-model) guide to learn how to add a model to your Vercel project.
