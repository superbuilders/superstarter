# Networks

> Combine one or more agents into a Network.

Networks are **Systems of [Agents](/concepts/agents)**. Use Networks to create powerful AI workflows by combining multiple Agents.

A network contains three components:

* The [Agents](/concepts/agents) that the network can use to achieve a goal
* A [State](/concepts/state) including past messages and a key value store, shared between Agents and the Router
* A [Router](/concepts/routers), which chooses whether to stop or select the next agent to run in the loop

Here's a simple example:

```tsx
import { createNetwork, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// searchAgent and summaryAgent definitions...

// Create a network with two agents.
const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
});

// Run the network with a user prompt
await network.run('What happened in the 2024 Super Bowl?');
```

By calling `run()`, the network runs a core loop to call one or more agents to find a suitable answer.

## How Networks work

Networks can be thought of as while loops with memory ([State](/concepts/state)) that call Agents and Tools until the Router determines that there is no more work to be done.

    You create a network with a list of available [Agents](/concepts/agents).
    Each Agent can use a different [model and inference
    provider](/concepts/models).

    You give the network a user prompt by calling `run()`.

    The network runs its core loop:

        The [Router](/concepts/routers) decides the first Agent to run with your
        input.

        Call the Agent with your input. This also runs the agent's
        [lifecycles](/concepts/agents#lifecycle-hooks), and any
        [Tools](/concepts/tools) that the model decides to call.

        Stores the result in the network's [State](/concepts/state). State can
        be accessed by the Router or other Agent's Tools in future loops.

        Return to the top of the loop and calls the Router with the new State.
        The Router can decide to quit or run another Agent.

## Model configuration

A Network must provide a default model which is used for routing between Agents and for Agents that don't have one:

```tsx
import { createNetwork, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// searchAgent and summaryAgent definitions...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o' }),
});
```

  A Network not defining a `defaultModel` and composed of Agents without model will throw an error.

### Combination of multiple models

Each Agent can specify it's own model to use so a Network may end up using multiple models. Here is an example of a Network that defaults to use an OpenAI model, but the `summaryAgent` is configured to use an Anthropic model:

```tsx
import { createNetwork, openai, anthropic } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const searchAgent = createAgent({
  name: 'Search',
  description: 'Search the web for information',
});

const summaryAgent = createAgent({
  name: 'Summary',
  description: 'Summarize the information',
  model: anthropic({ model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet' }),
});

// The searchAgent will use gpt-4o, while the summaryAgent will use claude-3-5-sonnet.
const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o' }),
});
```

## Routing & maximum iterations

### Routing

A Network can specify an optional `defaultRouter` function that will be used to determine the next Agent to run.

```ts
import { createNetwork } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// classifier and writer Agents definition...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [classifier, writer],
  router: ({ lastResult, callCount }) => {
    // retrieve the last message from the output
    const lastMessage = lastResult?.output[lastResult?.output.length - 1];
    const content = lastMessage?.type === 'text' ? lastMessage?.content as string : '';
    // First call: use the classifier
    if (callCount === 0) {
      return classifier;
    }
    // Second call: if it's a question, use the writer
    if (callCount === 1 && content.includes('question')) {
      return writer;
    }
    // Otherwise, we're done!
    return undefined;
  },
});
```

Refer to the [Router](/concepts/routers) documentation for more information about how to create a custom Router.

### Maximum iterations

A Network can specify an optional `maxIter` setting to limit the number of iterations.

```tsx
import { createNetwork } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// searchAgent and summaryAgent definitions...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: 'gpt-4o' }),
  maxIter: 10,
});
```

  Specifying a `maxIter` option is useful when using a [Default Routing Agent](/concepts/routers#default-routing-agent-autonomous-routing) or a [Hybrid Router](/concepts/routers#hybrid-code-and-agent-routers-semi-supervised-routing) to avoid infinite loops.

  A Routing Agent or Hybrid Router rely on LLM calls to make decisions, which means that they can sometimes fail to identify a final condition.

### Combining `maxIter` and `defaultRouter`

You can combine `maxIter` and `defaultRouter` to create a Network that will stop after a certain number of iterations or when a condition is met.

However, please note that the `maxIter` option can prevent the `defaultRouter` from being called (For example, if `maxIter` is set to 1, the `defaultRouter` will only be called once).

## Providing a default State

A Network can specify an optional `defaultState` setting to provide a default [State](/concepts/state).

```tsx
import { createNetwork } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

// searchAgent and summaryAgent definitions...

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [searchAgent, summaryAgent],
  defaultState: new State({
    foo: 'bar',
  }),
});
```

Providing a `defaultState` can be useful to persist the state in database between runs or initialize your network with external data.
