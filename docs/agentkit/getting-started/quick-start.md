# Quick start

> Learn the basics of AgentKit in a few minutes.

In this tutorial, you will create an [Agent](/concepts/agents) and run it within a [Network](/concepts/networks) using AgentKit.

  Follow this guide by forking the [quick-start](https://github.com/inngest/agent-kit/tree/main/examples/quick-start) example locally by running:

  ```shell  theme={"system"}
  npx git-ripper https://github.com/inngest/agent-kit/tree/main/examples/quick-start
  ```

## Creating a single agent

    Within an existing project, install AgentKit and Inngest from npm:

      ```shell npm theme={"system"}
      npm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest
      ```

      ```shell pnpm theme={"system"}
      pnpm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest
      ```

      ```shell yarn theme={"system"}
      yarn add @inngest/agent-kit inngest
      ```

      **Important:** Starting with AgentKit v0.9.0, `inngest` is a required peer dependency. You must install both packages together to ensure proper runtime compatibility and prevent conflicts.

    You can always find the latest release version on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inngest/agent-kit).

      To create a new project, create a new directory and initialize it using your package manager:

        ```shell npm theme={"system"}
        mkdir my-agent-kit-project && npm init
        ```

        ```shell pnpm theme={"system"}
        mkdir my-agent-kit-project && pnpm init
        ```

        ```shell yarn theme={"system"}
        mkdir my-agent-kit-project && yarn init
        ```

    To start, we'll create our first "[Agent](/concepts/agents)." An Agent is an entity that has a specific role to answer questions or perform tasks (see "tools" below).

    Let's create a new file, `index.ts`. Using the `createAgent` constructor, give your agent a `name`, a `description`, and its initial `system` prompt. The `name` and `description` properties are used to help the LLM determine which Agent to call.

    You'll also specify which `model` you want the agent to use. Here we'll use Anthropic's [Claude 3.5 Haiku](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models) model. ([Model reference](/concepts/models))

    Your agent can be whatever you want, but in this quick start, we'll create a PostgreSQL database administrator agent:

    ```ts index.ts theme={"system"}
    import { createAgent, anthropic } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

    const dbaAgent = createAgent({
      name: 'Database administrator',
      description: 'Provides expert support for managing PostgreSQL databases',
      system:
        'You are a PostgreSQL expert database administrator. ' +
        'You only provide answers to questions related to PostgreSQL database schema, indexes, and extensions.',
      model: anthropic({
        model: 'claude-3-5-haiku-latest',
        defaultParameters: {
          max_tokens: 1000,
        },
      }),
    });
    ```

    You'll also need to set your provider API keys as environment variables:

    ```shell terminal theme={"system"}
    export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-XXXXXX....
    ```

    Next, we'll create an HTTP server to run our agent. In the same file as our Agent definition:

    ```ts index.ts theme={"system"}
    import { createAgent, anthropic } from '@inngest/agent-kit';
    import { createServer } from '@inngest/agent-kit/server';
    // ...
    const server = createServer({
      agents: [dbaAgent],
    });
    server.listen(3000, () => console.log('AgentKit server running!'));
    ```

    Now we can run our AgentKit server using [`npx`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npx) and [`tsx`](https://tsx.is/) (for easy TypeScript execution):

    ```shell terminal theme={"system"}
    npx tsx ./index.ts
    ```

    To test our agent, we'll use the [Inngest dev server](https://www.inngest.com/docs/local-development) to visually debug our agents. Using `npx`, we'll start the server and point it to our AgentKit server:

    ```shell terminal theme={"system"}
    npx inngest-cli@latest dev -u http://localhost:3000/api/inngest
    ```

    Now, open the dev server and select the functions tab (`http://localhost:8288/functions`) and click the "Invoke" button:

    In the Invoke function modal, specify the input prompt for your agent and click the "Invoke function" button:

    ```json Invoke payload theme={"system"}
    {
      "data": {
        "input": "How do I aggregate an integer column across a date column by week?"
      }
    }
    ```

    You'll be redirected to watch the agent run and view the output:

A key benefit of AgentKit is the ability to create a system of agents called a
"[Network](/concepts/networks)." Networks are used to create AI Agents by combining
multiple specialized [Agents](/concepts/agents) to answer more complex questions.
Let's transform our single agent into a network of two agents, capable of helping with
both database administration and security questions.

## Creating a multi-agent network

    Agents collaborate in a Network by sharing a common [State](/concepts/state).

    Let's update our Database Administrator Agent to include a tool to save the answer to the question in the database:

    ```ts {13-24} theme={"system"}
    const dbaAgent = createAgent({
      name: "Database administrator",
      description: "Provides expert support for managing PostgreSQL databases",
      system:
        "You are a PostgreSQL expert database administrator. " +
        "You only provide answers to questions related to PostgreSQL database schema, indexes, and extensions.",
      model: anthropic({
        model: "claude-3-5-haiku-latest",
        defaultParameters: {
          max_tokens: 4096,
        },
      }),
      tools: [
        createTool({
          name: "save_answer",
          description: "Save the answer to the questions",
          parameters: z.object({
            answer: z.string(),
          }),
          handler: async ({ answer }, { network }: Tool.Options<NetworkState>) => {
            network.state.data.dba_agent_answer = answer;
          },
        }),
      ],
    });
    ```

      [Tools](/concepts/tools) are based on [Tool
      Calling](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview),
      enabling your Agent to interact with the [State](/concepts/state) of the
      Network, store data in external databases, or dynamically fetch data from
      third-party APIs.

    Let's now create a second *Database Security* Agent:

    ```ts {6-11, 26} theme={"system"}
    import { createAgent, anthropic } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

    // ...

    const securityAgent = createAgent({
      name: "Database Security Expert",
      description:
        "Provides expert guidance on PostgreSQL security, access control, audit logging, and compliance best practices",
      system:
        "You are a PostgreSQL security expert. " +
        "You only provide answers to questions related to PostgreSQL security topics such as encryption, access control, audit logging, and compliance best practices.",
      model: anthropic({
        model: "claude-3-5-haiku-latest",
        defaultParameters: {
          max_tokens: 1000,
        },
      }),
      tools: [
        createTool({
          name: "save_answer",
          description: "Save the answer to the questions",
          parameters: z.object({
            answer: z.string(),
          }),
          handler: async ({ answer }, { network }: Tool.Options<NetworkState>) => {
            network.state.data.security_agent_answer = answer;
          },
        }),
      ],
    });
    ```

    Our second Security Expert Agent is similar to the first, but with a different system prompt specifically for security questions.

    We can now create a network combining our "Database Administrator" and "Database Security" Agents, which enables us to answer more complex questions.

    Create a network using the `createNetwork` constructor. Define a `name` and include our agents from the previous step in the `agents` array.

    You must also configure a `router` that the [*Router*](/concepts/routers) will use to determine which agent to call:

    ```ts {14, 15-25} theme={"system"}
    import { /*...*/ createNetwork } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

    export interface NetworkState {
      // answer from the Database Administrator Agent
      dba_agent_answer?: string;

      // answer from the Security Expert Agent
      security_agent_answer?: string;
    }

    // ...
    const devOpsNetwork = createNetwork<NetworkState>({
      name: "DevOps team",
      agents: [dbaAgent, securityAgent],
      router: async ({ network }) => {
        if (!network.state.data.security_agent_answer) {
          return securityAgent;
        } else if (
          network.state.data.security_agent_answer &&
          network.state.data.dba_agent_answer
        ) {
          return;
        }
        return dbaAgent;
      },
    });

    const server = createServer({
      agents: [dbaAgent, securityAgent],
      networks: [devOpsNetwork],
    });
    ```

    The highlighted lines are the key parts of our AI Agent behavior:

    * The `agents` property defines the agents that are part of the network
    * The `router` function defines the logic for which agent to call next. In this example, we call the Database Administrator Agent followed by the Security Expert Agent before ending the network (by returning `undefined`).

    We'll use the same approach to test our network as we did above.

    With your Inngest dev server running, open the dev server and select the functions tab (`http://localhost:8288/functions`) and click the "Invoke" button of the *DevOps team* function with the following payload:

    ```json Invoke payload theme={"system"}
    {
      "data": {
        "input": "I am building a Finance application. Help me answer the following 2 questions: \n - How can I scale my application to millions of requests per second? \n - How should I design my schema to ensure the safety of each organization's data?"
      }
    }
    ```

    The network will now run through the Agents to answer the questions:

    You can inspect the answers of each Agent by selecting the *Finalization* step and inspecting the JSON payload in the right panel:

## Next steps

Congratulations! You've now created your first AI Agent with AgentKit.

In this guide, you've learned that:

* [**Agents**](/concepts/agents) are the building blocks of AgentKit. They are used to call a single model to answer specific questions or perform tasks.
* [**Networks**](/concepts/networks) are groups of agents that can work together to achieve more complex goals.
* [**Routers**](/concepts/routers), combined with [**State**](/concepts/state), enable you to control the flow of your Agents.

The following guides will help you build more advanced AI Agents:
