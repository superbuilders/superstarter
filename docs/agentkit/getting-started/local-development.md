# Local development

> Run AgentKit locally with live traces and logs.

Developing AgentKit applications locally is a breeze when combined with the [Inngest Dev Server](https://www.inngest.com/docs/dev-server).

The Inngest Dev Server is a local development tool that provides live traces and logs for your AgentKit applications, providing a
quicker feedback loop and full visibility into your AgentKit's state and Agent LLM calls:

## Using AgentKit with the Inngest Dev Server

### 1. Install the `inngest` package

To use AgentKit with the Inngest Dev Server, you need to install the `inngest` package.

  ```shell npm theme={"system"}
  npm install inngest
  ```

  ```shell pnpm theme={"system"}
  pnpm install inngest
  ```

  ```shell yarn theme={"system"}
  yarn add inngest
  ```

### 2. Expose your AgentKit network over HTTP

The Inngest Dev Server needs to be able to trigger your AgentKit network over HTTP.
If your AgentKit network runs as a CLI, a few lines changes will make it available over HTTP:

```ts {1, 8-13} theme={"system"}
import { createNetwork } from '@inngest/agent-kit';
import { createServer } from '@inngest/agent-kit/server';

const network = createNetwork({
  name: 'My Network',
  agents: [/* ... */],
});

const server = createServer({
  networks: [network],
});

server.listen(3010, () => console.log("Agent kit running!"));
```

Now, starting your AgentKit script will make it available over HTTP.

Let's now trigger our AgentKit network from the Inngest Dev Server.

### 3. Trigger your AgentKit network from the Inngest Dev Server

You can start the Inngest Dev Server with the following command:

```shell
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

And navigate to the Inngest Dev Server by opening [http://127.0.0.1:8288](http://127.0.0.1:8288) in your browser.

You can now explore the Inngest Dev Server features:

## Features

### Triggering your AgentKit network

You can trigger your AgentKit network by clicking on the "Trigger" button in the Inngest Dev Server from the "Functions" tab.
In the opened, add an `input` property with the input you want to pass to your AgentKit network:

Then, click on the "Run" button to trigger your AgentKit network"

### Inspect AgentKit Agents token usage, input and output

In the run view of your AgentKit network run, the Agents step will be highlighted with a ✨ green icon.
By expanding the step, you can inspect the Agents:

* The **model used**, ex: `gpt-4o`
* The **token usage** detailed as prompt tokens, completion tokens, and total tokens
* The **input** provided to the Agent
* The **output** provided by the Agent

  **Tips**

  You can force line breaks to **make the input and output more readable** using the following button: ![Inngest Dev Server agent run](https://mintcdn.com/inngest/UgDIu2BDE2TbH2t8/graphics/quick-start/dev-server-network-run-linebreak-btn.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=UgDIu2BDE2TbH2t8&q=85&s=16a9227f0750fdd4b7d79c4bd7197b0a)

  You can **expand the input and output view to show its full content** using the following button: ![Inngest Dev Server agent run](https://mintcdn.com/inngest/UgDIu2BDE2TbH2t8/graphics/quick-start/dev-server-network-run-expand-btn.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=UgDIu2BDE2TbH2t8&q=85&s=57a35cb5fd67b118ac855076af533b99)

  You can **update the input of an AgentKit Agent and trigger a rerun from this step** of the AgentKit network (*see below*)

### Rerun an AgentKit Agent with a different prompt

On a given AgentKit Agent run, you can update the input of the Agent and trigger a rerun from this step of the AgentKit network.

First, click on the "Rerun with new prompt" button under the input area.
Then, the following modal will open:
