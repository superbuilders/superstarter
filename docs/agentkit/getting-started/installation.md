# Installation

> How to install AgentKit

Install the AgentKit [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inngest/agent-kit) and [Inngest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inngest) using your favorite package manager:

  ```shell npm theme={"system"}
  npm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest
  ```

  ```shell pnpm theme={"system"}
  pnpm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest
  ```

  ```shell yarn theme={"system"}
  yarn add @inngest/agent-kit inngest
  ```

  **Important:** Starting with AgentKit v0.8.0, `inngest` is a required peer
  dependency. You must install both packages together to ensure proper runtime
  compatibility and prevent conflicts.

## Beyond installation

    Discover Inngest's Dev Server with live traces and logs.

    Add concurrency and throttling to your AgentKit network and deploy it to
    Inngest.
