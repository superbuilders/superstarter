# Using AgentKit with Daytona

> Build Coding Agents with Daytona's secure and elastic infrastructure for executing AI-generated code

[Daytona](https://www.daytona.io/) provides secure, high-performance infrastructure for running AI-generated code. It's designed for any use case requiring secure sandbox environments and lightning-fast execution: running code, spinning up applications, data analysis, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines and more.

Daytona is the perfect foundation for building autonomous Coding Agents that can scaffold projects, execute scripts, and deliver production-ready solutions.

## Setup

    Within an existing project, Install AgentKit and Daytona:

      ```shell npm theme={"system"}
      npm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest @daytonaio/sdk
      ```

      ```shell pnpm theme={"system"}
      pnpm install @inngest/agent-kit inngest @daytonaio/sdk
      ```

      ```shell yarn theme={"system"}
      yarn add @inngest/agent-kit inngest @daytonaio/sdk
      ```

      To create a new project, create a new directory then initialize using your package manager:

        ```shell npm theme={"system"}
        mkdir my-agent-kit-project && npm init
        ```

        ```shell pnpm theme={"system"}
        mkdir my-agent-kit-project && pnpm init
        ```

        ```shell yarn theme={"system"}
        mkdir my-agent-kit-project && yarn init
        ```

    Create a Coding Agent with a system prompt that defines its behavior and select a model with appropriate parameters. In this example, we use Anthropic's Claude model:

    ```typescript  theme={"system"}
    import {
      createAgent,
      anthropic,
    } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

    const codingAgent = createAgent({
      name: "Coding Agent",
      description:
        "An autonomous coding agent for building software in a Daytona sandbox",
      system: `You are a coding agent designed to help the user achieve software development tasks. You have access to a Daytona sandbox environment.

    Capabilities:
    - You can execute code snippets or scripts.
    - You can run shell commands to install dependencies, manipulate files, and set up environments.
    - You can create, upload, and organize files and directories to build basic applications and project structures.

    Workspace Instructions:
    - You do not need to define, set up, or specify the workspace directory. Assume you are already inside a default workspace directory that is ready for app creation.
    - All file and folder operations (create, upload, organize) should use paths relative to this default workspace.
    - Do not attempt to create or configure the workspace itself; focus only on the requested development tasks.

    Guidelines:
    - Always analyze the user's request and plan your steps before taking action.
    - Prefer automation and scripting over manual or interactive steps.
    - When installing packages or running commands that may prompt for input, use flags (e.g., '-y') to avoid blocking.
    - If you are developing an app that is served with a development server (e.g. Next.js, React):
      1. Return the port information in the form: DEV_SERVER_PORT=$PORT (replace $PORT with the actual port number).
      2. Start the development server.
      3. After starting the dev server, always check its health in the next iteration. Only mark the task as complete if the health check passes: there must be no stderr output, no errors thrown, and the stdout content must not indicate a problem (such as error messages, stack traces, or failed startup). If any of these are present, diagnose and fix the issue before completing the task.
    - When you have completed the requested task, set the "TASK_COMPLETED" string in your output to signal that the app is finished.
    `,
      model: anthropic({
        model: "claude-3-5-haiku-20241022",
        defaultParameters: {
          max_tokens: 1024,
        },
      }),
    });
    ```

    To fulfill the objectives specified in its system prompt, the Coding Agent needs access to sandbox environments; this is where Daytona steps in.

    The Daytona sandbox environment is exposed to the Coding Agent via tools. Our goal is to define a set of tools that enable the Coding Agent to achieve virtually any coding task.

    In this example, we'll show implementations of `codeRunTool` and `readFileTool`. Note that the code also uses `getSandbox` and `logDebug` utility functions for sandbox management and logging. You can find complete implementations of all coding agent tools and utility functions in the [Daytona Coding Agent example](https://github.com/inngest/agent-kit/tree/main/examples/daytona-coding-agent#readme).

    ```typescript {4, 6-8, 42 - 101} theme={"system"}
    import {
      createAgent,
      anthropic,
      createTool,
    } from "@inngest/agent-kit";
    import { z } from "zod";
    import { CodeRunParams, DaytonaError } from "@daytonaio/sdk";
    import { getSandbox, logDebug } from "./utils.js";

    Create a network with a code-based router that determines when the agent has completed its task and checks if a development server was started to set the data needed for preview generation.

    ```typescript  theme={"system"}
    import {
      createNetwork,
    } from "@inngest/agent-kit";
    import { extractTextMessageContent, logDebug } from "./utils.js";

      const network = createNetwork({
        name: "coding-agent-network",
        agents: [codingAgent], // Using codingAgent from previous step
        maxIter: 30,
        defaultRouter: ({ network, callCount }) => {
          const previousIterationMessageContent = extractTextMessageContent(
            network.state.results.at(-1)
          );
          if (previousIterationMessageContent)
            logDebug(`Iteration message:\n${previousIterationMessageContent}\n`);
          console.log(`\n ===== Iteration #${callCount + 1} =====\n`);
          if (callCount > 0) {
            if (previousIterationMessageContent.includes("TASK_COMPLETED")) {
              const isDevServerAppMessage = network.state.results.map((result) => extractTextMessageContent(result)).find((messageContent) =>
                messageContent.includes("DEV_SERVER_PORT")
              );
              if (isDevServerAppMessage) {
                const portMatch = isDevServerAppMessage.match(
                  /DEV_SERVER_PORT=([0-9]+)/
                );
                const port =
                  portMatch && portMatch[1]
                    ? parseInt(portMatch[1], 10)
                    : undefined;
                if (port) network.state.data.devServerPort = port;
              }
              return;
            }
          }
          return codingAgent;
        },
    });
