# Events

The `use-agent` hook is built on an event-driven architecture. Real-time events are streamed from the server, processed by a state reducer, and used to build the conversation UI incrementally. This document details the events, their purpose, and how you can use them.

## Understanding the Event Lifecycle

    A raw message is received from the Inngest realtime websocket connection

    The raw message is passed to an internal `mapToNetworkEvent` function, which transforms it into a standardized, strongly-typed `AgentKitEvent`. Invalid or unrecognized messages are discarded.

    The valid `AgentKitEvent` is dispatched to the internal `StreamingEngine`.

    The `streaming-reducer` processes the event. It uses a sequencing and buffering mechanism to ensure events are applied in the correct order, even if they arrive out of order.

    The reducer applies the event to the state, creating or updating messages and their parts.

    Your React UI re-renders with the new state.

    If configured, `onEvent`, `onStreamEnded`, or `onToolResult` callbacks are fired, allowing you to react to specific events.

## Core Events Reference

### Run Lifecycle Events

These events manage the overall state of an agent or network execution for a given turn.

#### `run.started`

* **Description**: Marks the beginning of an agent or network execution in response to a user message. This is often the first event in a sequence. It sets the agent's status to `submitted`.
* **Payload (`data`)**:
  * `threadId`: The ID of the thread this run belongs to.
  * `name`: The name of the agent or network that started.
  * `scope`: `"network"` or `"agent"`.
  * `runId`, `parentRunId`, `messageId`.
* **State Impact**: Sets `runActive: true`, `agentStatus: 'submitted'`, and may reset the event processing sequence if it's the start of a new "epoch".

#### `run.completed`

* **Description**: Indicates that an agent or network run has finished its logic. This does *not* mean all streaming is complete. It primarily finalizes any in-flight tool outputs.
* **Payload (`data`)**: `threadId`, `scope`, `runId`, `messageId`, `name`.
* **State Impact**: Finalizes the state of any tools that were in the `executing` state, moving them to `output-available`. The overall agent status is not yet changed to `ready`.

#### `stream.ended`

* **Description**: The final event in a sequence. It indicates that all streaming for a turn is complete and the agent is now idle.
* **Payload (`data`)**: `threadId`, `scope`, `runId`, `messageId`, `name`.
* **State Impact**: Sets `runActive: false` and `agentStatus: 'ready'`. This signals that the system is ready for new user input.

### Content Streaming Events

These events are responsible for building the assistant's response message part by part.

#### `part.created`

* **Description**: Signals the creation of a new part within an assistant message.
* **Payload (`data`)**:
  * `messageId`: The ID of the message this part belongs to.
  * `partId`: The unique ID for this new part.
  * `type`: Either `"text"` or `"tool-call"`.
  * `metadata`: Optional data, often includes `toolName` for tool calls.
* **State Impact**: Adds a new, empty `TextUIPart` or `ToolCallUIPart` to the parts array of the corresponding message.

#### `text.delta`

* **Description**: Streams a chunk of text for a `TextUIPart`.
* **Payload (`data`)**:
  * `messageId`, `partId`.
  * `delta`: The string of text to append.
* **State Impact**: Appends the `delta` content to the specified `TextUIPart`.

#### `part.completed`

* **Description**: Marks a specific message part as complete. The payload varies based on the part type.
* **Payload (`data`)**:
  * `messageId`, `partId`.
  * `type`: Can be `"text"`, `"tool-call"`, or `"tool-output"`.
  * `finalContent`: The complete, final content for the part (e.g., the full text or final tool output).
* **State Impact**:
  * For `"text"`: Sets the part's `status` to `complete`.
  * For `"tool-call"`: Sets the tool's `state` to `input-available` and populates the final `input`.
  * For `"tool-output"`: Sets the tool's `state` to `output-available` and populates the final `output`.

### Tool Call Events

These events are specific to the lifecycle of tool calls made by an agent.

#### `tool_call.arguments.delta`

* **Description**: Streams a chunk of the JSON arguments for a tool call.
* **Payload (`data`)**:
  * `messageId`, `partId`.
  * `delta`: A string chunk of the JSON arguments object.
* **State Impact**: Appends the `delta` to the `input` field of the `ToolCallUIPart`. The reducer attempts to parse the accumulating string as JSON. Sets the tool's `state` to `input-streaming`.

#### `tool_call.output.delta`

* **Description**: Streams a chunk of the output from a tool execution.
* **Payload (`data`)**:
  * `messageId`, `partId`.
  * `delta`: A string chunk of the tool's output.
* **State Impact**: Appends the `delta` to the `output` field of the `ToolCallUIPart`. Sets the tool's `state` to `executing`.

## Consuming Events in Your App

The `useAgent` hook provides callbacks to tap into this event stream.

### `onEvent`

This is the lowest-level callback. It fires for every single valid `AgentKitEvent` that the hook processes, giving you full visibility into the streaming process.

```jsx
useAgent({
  onEvent: (evt, meta) => {
    console.log('Event received:', evt.event, 'for thread:', meta.threadId);
    if (evt.event === 'run.started') {
      // Show a global "thinking" indicator
    }
  }
})
```

### `onToolResult`

A convenient, strongly-typed callback that fires only when a tool has finished executing and its final output is available (`part.completed` with `type: "tool-output"`).

```jsx
useAgent<MyAgentConfig>({
  onToolResult: (result) => {
    if (result.toolName === 'getWeather') {
      const weatherData = result.data; // strongly typed!
      // Display a custom weather component
    }
  }
})
```

### `onStreamEnded`

Fires when the entire sequence of events for a turn is complete (`stream.ended`). Useful for triggering actions after the assistant has fully responded.

```jsx
useAgent({
  onStreamEnded: ({ threadId }) => {
    console.log(`Agent has finished responding in thread ${threadId}.`);
    // Maybe run some analytics or enable the input field
  }
})
```
