> Realtime event streaming with AgentKit + useAgent

With a useAgent hook you can seamlessly stream a network of agents, a single agent and durable steps within tools used by your agents. You can think of useAgent as the bridge between durable agents and your user interface.

Instead of stitching together events, workflow steps and token streams - your UI receives structured events that describe lifecycles, content parts, tool calls and completions. This hook consumes these events and maintains your UI state for a single conversation or many conversations in parallel.

Here's a simple example of how you would use the hook in your React component:

```tsx
import { useAgent } from "@inngest/use-agent";

export function MyAgentUI() {
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useAgent();

  const onSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const value = new FormData(e.currentTarget).get("input");
    sendMessage(value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {messages.map(({ id, role, parts }) => (
          <li key={id}>
            <div>{role}</div>
            {parts.map(({ id, type, content }) =>
              type === "text" ? <div key={id}>{content}</div> : null
            )}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
        <input name="input" />
        <button type="submit" disabled={status !== "ready"}>
          Send
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Let's take a closer look at what components, endpoints and other files we will need to wire this all up:

* **Inngest Client (`/api/inngest/client.ts`)**: Initializes Inngest with the `realtimeMiddleware`.
* **Realtime Channel (`/api/inngest/realtime.ts`)**: Defines a typed realtime channel and topic.
* **Chat Route: `/api/chat/route.ts`**: This is a standard Next.js API route. Its only job is to receive a request from the frontend and send an event to Inngest to trigger a function.
* **Token Route: `/api/realtime/token/route.ts`**: This secure endpoint generates a subscription token that the frontend needs to connect to Inngest realtime.
* **Inngest Route: `/api/inngest/route.ts`**: The standard handler that serves all your Inngest functions.

Once you've configured all the foundational endpoints needed for streaming, you'll want to create some agents, define types and integrate this into a UI:

    Define your server-side state type, import all your tools and pass them into `createToolManifest` to generate a type that you will use in your UI.

    ```typescript  theme={"system"}
    import { createToolManifest, type StateData } from "@inngest/agent-kit";
    import { selectEventsTool } from "./event-matcher";
    import { generateSqlTool } from "./query-writer";

    // server-side state used by networks, routers and agents
    export type AgentState = StateData & {
        userId?: string;
        eventTypes?: string[];
        schemas?: Record<string, unknown>;
        selectedEvents?: { event_name: string; reason: string }[];
        currentQuery?: string;
        sql?: string;
    };

    // a typed manifest of all available tools
    const manifest = createToolManifest([
        generateSqlTool,
        selectEventsTool,
    ] as const);

    export type ToolManifest = typeof manifest;
    ```

    Create a `ClientState` type which will type state that your UI will send to your agent backend. This is a great place to pass along important context about the user or what they're doing in your app.

    ```typescript  theme={"system"}
    import {
      useAgent,
      type AgentKitEvent,
      type UseAgentsConfig,
      type UseAgentsReturn,
    } from "@inngest/use-agent";

    import type { ToolManifest } from "@/app/api/inngest/functions/agents/types";

    export type ClientState = {
      sqlQuery: string;
      eventTypes: string[];
      schemas: Record<string, unknown> | null;
      currentQuery: string;
    };

    export type AgentConfig = { tools: ToolManifest; state: ClientState };

    export type AgentEvent = AgentKitEvent<ToolManifest>;

    export function useInsightsAgent(
      config: UseAgentsConfig<ToolManifest, ClientState>
    ): UseAgentsReturn<ToolManifest, ClientState> {
      return useAgent<{ tools: ToolManifest; state: ClientState }>(config);
    }
    ```
