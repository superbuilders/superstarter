# Provider

> A deep dive into the provider for streaming agents

The `AgentProvider` is a React component that creates a shared context for all `useAgent` hooks in your application. While it's optional, using it is highly recommended as it improves performance and ensures configuration consistency.

## Why Use the Provider?

By wrapping your agent-driven components in `AgentProvider`, you get several key benefits:

* **Performance**: A single WebSocket connection is established and shared across all components, reducing network overhead.
* **Consistency**: A shared transport configuration, user context, and channel key are used by all hooks, preventing inconsistencies.
* **Flexibility**: Individual hooks can still override the shared configuration if needed for specific cases.
* **Anonymous Users**: The provider automatically generates and persists a unique ID for anonymous users, allowing them to have a consistent experience across page loads.

## How It Works

`AgentProvider` creates a React Context that provides a shared transport instance, connection, and user information to any `useAgent` hook rendered within it. The hooks will automatically detect and use the context if it's available.

If you don't use the provider, each `useAgent` hook will create its own transport and connection, which is less efficient.

## Usage Patterns

Here are some common ways to use the `AgentProvider`.

### Basic Authenticated User

For an application with logged-in users, pass the user's unique ID to the `userId` prop. This ensures that the agent's context is tied to the correct user.

```tsx
import { AgentProvider } from "@inngest/use-agent";
import { ChatPage } from "./ChatPage";
import { ThreadsSidebar } from "./ThreadsSidebar";

function App({ userId }) {
  return (
    <AgentProvider userId={userId}>
      <ChatPage />
      <ThreadsSidebar />
    </AgentProvider>
  );
}
```

### Anonymous Users

If your application supports guest users, you can omit the `userId` prop. The provider will automatically create a unique anonymous ID and store it in `sessionStorage` to maintain a consistent experience for the user during their session.

```tsx
import { AgentProvider } from "@inngest/use-agent";
import { GuestChatInterface } from "./GuestChatInterface";

function App() {
  return (
    <AgentProvider>
      <GuestChatInterface />
    </AgentProvider>
  );
}
```

### Collaborative Sessions

To create shared, collaborative sessions (e.g., a chat where multiple users interact with the same agent in a shared context), you can use the `channelKey` prop. All users who connect with the same `channelKey` will be subscribed to the same real-time channel.

```tsx
import { AgentProvider } from "@inngest/use-agent";
import { CollaborativeChat } from "./CollaborativeChat";

function ProjectChat({ projectId }) {
  return (
    <AgentProvider channelKey={`project-${projectId}`}>
      <CollaborativeChat />
    </AgentProvider>
  );
}
```

### Custom Transport Configuration

You can customize the HTTP endpoints and headers used by the transport layer by passing a configuration object to the `transport` prop. This is useful if your API routes don't follow the default conventions.

```tsx
import { AgentProvider } from "@inngest/use-agent";

function App({ userId, getAuthToken }) {
  return (
    <AgentProvider
      userId={userId}
      transport={{
        api: {
          sendMessage: '/api/v2/chat',
          fetchThreads: '/api/v2/threads'
        },
        headers: () => ({
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${getAuthToken()}`,
        })
      }}
    >
      <ChatApp />
    </AgentProvider>
  );
}
```
