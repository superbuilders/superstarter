# createAgent

> Define an agent

Agents are defined using the `createAgent` function.

```ts
import { createAgent, agenticOpenai as openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';

const agent = createAgent({
  name: 'Code writer',
  system:
    'You are an expert TypeScript programmer.  Given a set of asks, you think step-by-step to plan clean, ' +
    'idiomatic TypeScript code, with comments and tests as necessary.' +
    'Do not respond with anything else other than the following XML tags:' +
    '- If you would like to write code, add all code within the following tags (replace $filename and $contents appropriately):' +
    "  <file name='$filename.ts'>$contents</file>",
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
});
```

## Options

**name** `string` *(required)*
  The name of the agent. Displayed in tracing.

**description** `string`
  Optional description for the agent, used for LLM-based routing to help the
  network pick which agent to run next.

**model** `string` *(required)*
  The provider model to use for inference calls.

**system** `string | function` *(required)*
  The system prompt, as a string or function. Functions let you change prompts
  based off of state and memory.

**tools** `array<TypedTool>`
  Defined tools that an agent can call.

  Tools are created via [`createTool`](/reference/createTool).

**lifecycle** `Lifecycle`
  Lifecycle hooks that can intercept and modify inputs and outputs throughout the stages of execution of `run()`.

  Learn about each [lifecycle](#lifecycle) hook that can be defined below.

### `lifecycle`

**onStart** `function`
  Called after the initial prompt messages are created and before the inference call request. The `onStart` hook can be used to:

  * Modify input prompt for the Agent.
  * Prevent the agent from being called by throwing an error.

**onResponse** `function`
  Called after the inference call request is completed and before tool calling. The `onResponse` hook can be used to:

  * Inspect the tools that the model decided to call.
  * Modify the response prior to tool calling.

**onFinish** `function`
  Called after tool calling has completed. The `onFinish` hook can be used to:

  * Modify the `InferenceResult` including the outputs prior to the result being added to [Network state](/concepts/network-state).

  ```ts onStart theme={"system"}
  const agent = createAgent({
    name: 'Code writer',
    lifecycles: {
      onStart: ({
        agent,
        network,
        input,
        system, // The system prompt for the agent
        history, // An array of messages
      }) => {
        // Return the system prompt (the first message), and any history added to the
        // model's conversation.
        return { system, history };
      },
    },
  });
  ```

  ```ts onResponse theme={"system"}
  function onResponse() {}
  ```
