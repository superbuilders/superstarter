# Multi-steps tools

> Use multi-steps tools to create more complex Agents.

In this guide, we'll learn how to create a multi-steps tool that can be used in your AgentKit [Tools](/concepts/tools) to reliably perform complex operations.

By combining your AgentKit network with Inngest, each step of your tool will be **retried automatically** and you'll be able to **configure concurrency and throttling**.

  **Prerequisites**

  Your AgentKit network [must be configured with Inngest](/getting-started/local-development#1-install-the-inngest-package).

## Creating a multi-steps tool

Creating a multi-steps tool is done by creating an Inngest Function that will be used as a tool in your AgentKit network.

To create an Inngest Function, you'll need to create an Inngest Client:

```ts src/inngest/client.ts theme={"system"}
import { Inngest } from 'inngest';

const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: 'my-agentkit-network',
});
```

Then, we will implement our AgentKit Tool as an Inngest Function with multiple steps.
For example, we'll create a tool that searches for perform a research by crawling the web:

```ts src/inngest/tools/research-web.ts {10, 22, 27} theme={"system"}
import { inngest } from '../client';

export const researchWebTool = inngest.createFunction({ 
  id: 'research-web-tool',
}, {
  event: "research-web-tool/run"
}, async ({ event, step }) => {
    const { input } = event.data;

    const searchQueries = await step.ai.infer('generate-search-queries', {
      model: step.ai.models.openai({ model: "gpt-4o" }),
      // body is the model request, which is strongly typed depending on the model
      body: {
        messages: [{
          role: "user",
          content: `From the given input, generate a list of search queries to perform. \n ${input}`,
        }],
      },
    });

    const searchResults = await Promise.all(
        searchQueries.map(query => step.run('crawl-web', async (query) => {
        // perform crawling...
        })
    ));

    const summary = await step.ai.infer('summarize-search-results', {
      model: step.ai.models.openai({ model: "gpt-4o" }),
      body: {
        messages: [{
          role: "user",
          content: `Summarize the following search results: \n ${searchResults.join('\n')}`,
        }],
      },
    });

    return summary.choices[0].message.content;
});
```

Our `researchWebTool` Inngest defines 3 main steps.

* The `step.ai.infer()` call will offload the LLM requests to the Inngest infrastructe which will also handle retries.
* The `step.run()` call will run the `crawl-web` step in parallel.

All the above steps will be retried automatically in case of failure, resuming the AgentKit network upon completion of the tool.

## Using the multi-steps tool in your AgentKit network

We can now add our `researchWebTool` to our AgentKit network:

```ts src/inngest/agent-network.ts {2, 7, 18} theme={"system"}
import { createAgent, createNetwork, openai } from '@inngest/agent-kit';
import { createServer } from '@inngest/agent-kit/server';

import { researchWebTool } from './inngest/tools/research-web';

const deepResearchAgent = createAgent({ 
  name: 'Deep Research Agent',
  tools: [researchWebTool],
});

const network = createNetwork({
  name: 'My Network',
  defaultModel: openai({ model: "gpt-4o" }),
  agents: [deepResearchAgent],
});

const server = createServer({
  networks: [network],
  functions: [researchWebTool],
});

server.listen(3010, () => console.log("Agent kit running!"));
```

We first import our `researchWebTool` function and pass it to the `deepResearchAgent` [`tools` array](/reference/create-agent#param-tools).

Finally, we also need to pass the `researchWebTool` function to the `createServer()`'s `functions` array.
