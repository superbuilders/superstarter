# Human in the Loop

> Enable your Agents to wait for human input.

Agents such as Support Agents, Coding or Research Agents might require human oversight.

By combining AgentKit with Inngest, you can create [Tools](/concepts/tools) that can wait for human input.

## Creating a "Human in the Loop" tool

"Human in the Loop" tools are implemented using Inngest's [`waitForEvent()`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/wait-for-event) step method:

```ts
import { createTool } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

createTool({
  name: "ask_developer",
  description: "Ask a developer for input on a technical issue",
  parameters: z.object({
    question: z.string().describe("The technical question for the developer"),
    context: z.string().describe("Additional context about the issue"),
  }),
  handler: async ({ question, context }, { step }) => {
    if (!step) {
      return { error: "This tool requires step context" };
    }

    // Example: Send a Slack message to the developer

    // Wait for developer response event
    const developerResponse = await step.waitForEvent("developer.response", {
      event: "app/support.ticket.developer-response",
      timeout: "4h",
      match: "data.ticketId",
    });

    if (!developerResponse) {
      return { error: "No developer response provided" };
    }

    return {
      developerResponse: developerResponse.data.answer,
      responseTime: developerResponse.data.timestamp,
    };
  },
});
```

The `ask_developer` tool will wait up to 4 hours for a `"developer.response"` event to be received, pausing the execution of the AgentKit network.
The incoming `"developer.response"` event will be matched against the `data.ticketId` field of the event that trigger the AgentKit network.
For this reason, the AgentKit network will need to be wrapped in an Inngest function as demonstrated in the next section.

## Example: Support Agent with Human in the Loop

Let's consider a Support Agent Network automously triaging and solving tickets:

```tsx
const customerSupportAgent = createAgent({
  name: "Customer Support",
  description:
    "I am a customer support agent that helps customers with their inquiries.",
  system: `You are a helpful customer support agent.
Your goal is to assist customers with their questions and concerns.
Be professional, courteous, and thorough in your responses.`,
  model: anthropic({
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku-latest",
    max_tokens: 1000,
  }),
  tools: [
    searchKnowledgeBase,
    // ...
  ],
});

const technicalSupportAgent = createAgent({
  name: "Technical Support",
  description: "I am a technical support agent that helps critical tickets.",
  system: `You are a technical support specialist.
Your goal is to help resolve critical tickets.
Use your expertise to diagnose problems and suggest solutions.
If you need developer input, use the ask_developer tool.`,
  model: anthropic({
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku-latest",
    max_tokens: 1000,
  }),
  tools: [
    searchLatestReleaseNotes,
    // ...
  ],
});

const supervisorRoutingAgent = createRoutingAgent({
  // ...
});

// Create a network with the agents and default router
const supportNetwork = createNetwork({
  name: "Support Network",
  agents: [customerSupportAgent, technicalSupportAgent],
  defaultModel: anthropic({
    model: "claude-3-5-haiku-latest",
    max_tokens: 1000,
  }),
  router: supervisorRoutingAgent,
});
```

  You can find the complete example code in the
  [examples/support-agent-human-in-the-loop](https://github.com/inngest/agent-kit/tree/main/examples/support-agent-human-in-the-loop)
  directory.

To avoid the Support Agent to be stuck or classifying tickets incorrectly, we'll implement a "Human in the Loop" tool to enable a human to add some context.

To implement a "Human in the Loop" tool, we'll need to embed our AgentKit network into an Inngest function.

### Transforming your AgentKit network into an Inngest function

First, you'll need to create an Inngest Client:

```ts src/inngest/client.ts theme={"system"}
import { Inngest } from "inngest";

const inngest = new Inngest({
  id: "my-agentkit-network",
});
```

Then, transform your AgentKit network into an Inngest function as follows:

```ts src/inngest/agent-network.ts {21-54} theme={"system"}
import { createAgent, createNetwork, openai } from "@inngest/agent-kit";
import { createServer } from "@inngest/agent-kit/server";

const customerSupportAgent = createAgent({
  name: "Customer Support",
  // ..
});

const technicalSupportAgent = createAgent({
  name: "Technical Support",
  // ..
});

// Create a network with the agents and default router
const supportNetwork = createNetwork({
  name: "Support Network",
  agents: [customerSupportAgent, technicalSupportAgent],
  // ..
});

const supportAgentWorkflow = inngest.createFunction(
  {
    id: "support-agent-workflow",
  },
  {
    event: "app/support.ticket.created",
  },
  async ({ step, event }) => {
    const ticket = await step.run("get_ticket_details", async () => {
      const ticket = await getTicketDetails(event.data.ticketId);
      return ticket;
    });

    if (!ticket || "error" in ticket) {
      throw new NonRetriableError(`Ticket not found: ${ticket.error}`);
    }

    const response = await supportNetwork.run(ticket.title);

    return {
      response,
      ticket,
    };
  }
);

// Create and start the server
const server = createServer({
  functions: [supportAgentWorkflow as any],
});

server.listen(3010, () =>
  console.log("Support Agent demo server is running on port 3010")
);
```

The `network.run()` is now performed by the Inngest function.

Don't forget to register the function with `createServer`'s `functions` property.

### Add a `ask_developer` tool to the network

Our AgentKit network is now ran inside an Inngest function triggered by the `"app/support.ticket.created"` event which carries
the `data.ticketId` field.

The `Technical Support` Agent will now use the `ask_developer` tool to ask a developer for input on a technical issue:

```ts
import { createTool } from "@inngest/agent-kit";

createTool({
  name: "ask_developer",
  description: "Ask a developer for input on a technical issue",
  parameters: z.object({
    question: z.string().describe("The technical question for the developer"),
    context: z.string().describe("Additional context about the issue"),
  }),
  handler: async ({ question, context }, { step }) => {
    if (!step) {
      return { error: "This tool requires step context" };
    }

    // Example: Send a Slack message to the developer

    // Wait for developer response event
    const developerResponse = await step.waitForEvent("developer.response", {
      event: "app/support.ticket.developer-response",
      timeout: "4h",
      match: "data.ticketId",
    });

    if (!developerResponse) {
      return { error: "No developer response provided" };
    }

    return {
      developerResponse: developerResponse.data.answer,
      responseTime: developerResponse.data.timestamp,
    };
  },
});
```

Our `ask_developer` tool will now wait for a `"developer.response"` event to be received (ex: from a Slack message), and match it against the `data.ticketId` field.

The result of the `ask_developer` tool will be returned to the `Technical Support` Agent.

Look at the Inngest [`step.waitForEvent()`](https://www.inngest.com/docs/features/inngest-functions/steps-workflows/wait-for-event) documentation for more details and examples.

### Try it out

  This Support AgentKit Network is composed of two Agents (Customer Support and
  Technical Support) and a Supervisor Agent that routes the ticket to the
  correct Agent. The Technical Support Agent can wait for a developer response
  when facing complex technical issues.
