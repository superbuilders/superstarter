# AgentKit

> A TypeScript library to create and orchestrate AI Agents.

AgentKit is a framework to build AI Agents, from single model inference calls to multi-agent systems that use tools. Designed with orchestration at its core, AgentKit enables developers to build, test, and deploy reliable AI applications at scale.

With AgentKit, you get:

✨ **Simple and composable primitives** to build from simple Support Agents to semi-autonomous Coding Agents.

🧠 **Support for [OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini](/concepts/models)** and all OpenAI API compatible models.

🛠️ **Powerful tools building API** with support for [MCP as tools](/advanced-patterns/mcp).

🔌 **Integrates** with your favorite AI libraries and products (ex: [E2B](/integrations/e2b), [Browserbase](/integrations/browserbase), [Smithery](/integrations/smithery), [Daytona](/integrations/daytona)).

⚡ **Stream live updates** to your UI with [UI Streaming](/advanced-patterns/ui-streaming).

📊 **[Local Live traces](/getting-started/local-development) and input/output logs** when combined with the Inngest Dev Server.

## How AgentKit works

    AgentKit enables developers to compose simple single-agent systems or entire
    *systems of agents* in which multiple agents can work together.
    **[Agents](/concepts/agents)** are combined into
    **[Networks](concepts/networks)** which include a
    **[Router](concepts/routers)** to determine which Agent should be called.
    Their system's memory is recorded as Network **[State](concepts/state)** which
    can be used by the Router, Agents or **[Tools](concepts/tools)** to
    collaborate on tasks.

The entire system is orchestration-aware and allows for customization at runtime for dynamic, powerful AI workflows and agentic systems. Here is what a simple Network looks like in code:

```ts
import {
  createNetwork,
  createAgent,
  openai,
  anthropic,
} from "@inngest/agent-kit";
import { searchWebTool } from "./tools";

const navigator = createAgent({
  name: "Navigator",
  system: "You are a navigator...",
  tools: [searchWebTool],
});

const classifier = createAgent({
  name: "Classifier",
  system: "You are a classifier...",
  model: openai("gpt-3.5-turbo"),
});

const summarizer = createAgent({
  model: anthropic("claude-3-5-haiku-latest"),
  name: "Summarizer",
  system: "You are a summarizer...",
});

const network = createNetwork({
  agents: [navigator, classifier, summarizer],
  defaultModel: openai({ model: "gpt-4o" }),
});

const input = `Classify then summarize the latest 10 blog posts
  on https://www.deeplearning.ai/blog/`;

const result = await network.run(input, ({ network }) => {
  return defaultRoutingAgent;
});
```

## `llms.txt`

You can access the entire AgentKit docs in markdown format at [agentkit.inngest.com/llms-full.txt](https://agentkit.inngest.com/llms-full.txt). This is useful for passing the entire docs to an LLM, AI-enabled IDE, or similar tool to answer questions about AgentKit.

If your context window is too small to pass the entire docs, you can use the shorter [agentkit.inngest.com/llms.txt](https://agentkit.inngest.com/llms.txt) file which offers a table of contents for LLMs or other developer tools to index the docs more easily.
